# NUTS — NMR Utilities for Testing Solids

Welcome to NUTS — a slightly ridiculous name for a useful set of NMR tools. We're a small group of NMR lads working at the intersection of solid-state NMR and computational chemistry, and we've come together to build Python-based utilities to make working with NMR data a little less painful.

## What’s in the shell right now?
We're actively developing and maintaining the following tools:

### **Spinplots**
A lightweight and flexible plotting library designed specifically for NMR data in Python. Its main goal is to generate publication-quality NMR spectra with just a few lines of code. Check it out [here](https://github.com/nuts-org/spinplots)

### **SimPYson**
A Pythonic interface for [SIMPSON](https://inano.au.dk/about/research-centers-and-projects/nmr/software/simpson) a popular code to simulate solid-state NMR experiments. Prepare SIMPSON input files, including spin systems and pulse sequences, and analyze SIMPSON results in few lines of code. More information [here](https://github.com/nuts-org/simpyson)

## Want to contribute?
Have ideas? Found bugs? Want to make this better? We'd love help and suggestions from fellow NMR enthusiasts. Whether you're into Python, pulse sequences, or plotting aesthetics — pull requests, issues, and discussions are always welcome.
